# cynthias-master-refactor

## Description

The webpage was created for an assignment where full Stack Students had to take an initial written code created by Horiseon which needed to be refactored and improved by using semantic elements in order for developers to clearly read the code especially when collaborating on a single project remotely. By doing so, this webpage will be able to follow accessibility standards and will be optimized for SEO - Search Engine Optimization.
